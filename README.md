*A smart Chrome extension for tracking reading progress, summarizing content, and managing bookmarks with AI-powered features.*

## 📖 Overview

Vibrant Progress Tracker is a powerful Chrome extension designed to help users track their reading progress across web pages, save bookmarks with scroll positions, and leverage AI for content summarization, rewriting, translation, and more. Built with modern web technologies, it integrates Chrome's built-in AI APIs (where available) and falls back to external services like Gemini for seamless functionality.

The extension includes features like live progress tracking, a floating widget, daily reminders, a calendar for task scheduling, and an assistant modal for AI-driven content processing. It's perfect for students, researchers, and avid readers who want to stay organized and productive.

### Key Highlights
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatically saves scroll positions and displays progress bars.
- **AI Integration**: Summarize, rewrite, translate, and generate content using Chrome's AI or Gemini API.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Dark/light theme toggle, responsive design, and intuitive modals.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any website, with special support for YouTube videos.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Processes content locally where possible; no data sent without user consent.
